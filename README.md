# Chernobyl - How It Was.

It has come to the translator's attention that but two incomplete renderings of this work are presently in circulation. Neither has sought to render the book accessible to readers unacquainted with the technical phraseology or administrative machinery of the Soviet era. They retain, moreover, the original Russian abbreviations and refer to sources scarce or altogether inaccessible. The present translation intends to remedy these defects by supplying such explanations and contextual remarks as may assist the general reader, while maintaining, so far as may be, fidelity to the author's text and manner.

The footnotes are of mixed character: part consist of the translator's own observations, part of supplementary information designed to make clear expressions or analogies which might otherwise remain unclear. Some reproduce or explain Russian terms and abbreviations; others furnish the historical or technical background requisite for understanding.

The original flow of the book (that is, starting from the first chapter until the beginning of the appendices) has been preserved. The translator, however, wished to compile more documents related to the contents of the book, as well as preserve certain rare materials cited within the text.

The translation has been completed up to Chapter 12; remaining four chapters as well as the supplementary material are in progress. The translator hopes to make them available in due course. Additional proof-reading and editing has been completed up to and including Chapter 3. Final editing (unification of abbreviations, writing style, etc.) has not yet commenced.

Criticism of this translation, as well as any suggestions toward its improvement, will be gratefully received and may be addressed to `k@iczelia.net`.

The translator dedicates the derived part of the work to the public domain by waiving all of her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.
